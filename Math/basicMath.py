Notes:

    main() has to go at the end of the file (always) as none of the functions you were calling 'exist' yet
    call functions with () not (): 
    watch indentation when defining a function, always tab in to write in the function ( basicMath() )
    no need to call functions within your code / between functions! that is what main() is for
    importing cmath within a function doesn't seem to be an issue, but it is standard to do it at the beginning of a file unless specified
    make sure you initialize your input to somthing other than a str to do calculations. I chose float(input('')) but you can make it an int if needed
